// To use the logger, user should use the macros defined in this
// file rather than passing flags to logger's function. This would make
// logging easy to control since logger can be easily turned on/off
// by setting 'LOG_ENABLE' macro here. Using macros also make code more
// clean and lessen the burden of user to keep function arguments in 
// right order.
